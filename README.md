# Capstone Project: Optimizing Storage Constraints and Efficient Employment of Capital

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation for the capstone project titled "Optimizing storage constraints and efficient employment of capital 
among different categories of products in a versatile shop".
This project is part of the BDM Capstone Project for the IITM Online BS Degree Program, submitted by Abhijit Nandi.

## Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to optimize storage constraints and efficiently employ capital among various product categories in a versatile shop. 
The shop, named Nandi Variety, deals primarily in selling raw materials needed by ice cream manufacturing mills, bakeries, and hardware products such as wood polish. 
The focus of this project is on the ice cream segment.

## Key Objectives

1. Optimize Storage Constraints: Organize different categories of products (e.g., fast-selling and expensive, fast-selling but low-cost, slow-selling but expensive,
   slow-selling and low-cost) to ensure proper stock maintenance without overspending or stockouts.
2. Efficient Capital Expenditure: Develop strategies to balance capital expenditure across categories while considering storage needs and predicting demand.
3. Address Stock-Out Issues: Propose ideas to tackle frequent stock-out issues and counter fluctuating prices.

## Research Methodology

The project follows a comprehensive research methodology involving data collection, cleaning, and analysis:

1. **Data Collection**: Primary data was collected from Nandi Variety, including sales data (January-May 2022) and purchase data (October 2021-May 2022).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicities, arranged inventory into different categories, and imputed missing information.
3. **Identification of Products of Concern (POCs)**: Using Pareto analysis, identified 25 products generating the highest income.
   
4. **Categorization of POCs**: Categorized POCs based on average sales volume and unit price into four categories:
   fast-selling and expensive, fast-selling but low-cost, slow-selling but expensive, and slow-selling and low-cost.
5. **Demand and Price Analysis**: Conducted regression and correlation analysis to understand demand trends and price fluctuations.
6. **Safety Stock and Storage Solutions**: Calculated storage space requirements and developed strategies to manage storage efficiently.

## Results and Findings

The analysis provided several key insights:

1. **Demand Trends**: Identified stable and fluctuating demand patterns for different products.
2. **Price Fluctuations**: Noted significant price variations in certain products, suggesting bulk purchasing during off-seasons.
3. **Storage Solutions**: Proposed efficient storage solutions based on product categories and demand patterns.
4. **Safety Stock** Recommendations: Suggested maintaining safety stock levels to prevent stockouts.

## Recommendations

Based on the study, the following recommendations were made:

1. Prioritize High-Revenue Products: Focus on products that generate the highest revenue and optimize their storage.
2. Bulk Purchase Strategy: For products with stable demand and significant price fluctuations, bulk purchase during off-seasons to minimize costs.
3. Non-Food Product Storage: Store non-food products like clay, wood, paper, and plastic with varnish products to avoid contamination.
4. Regular Monitoring and Adjustment: Continuously monitor sales and purchase data to adjust strategies as needed.
